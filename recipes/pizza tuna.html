      <h2>This tasty and easy tuna pizza is amazing all year round. You may make your own dough, use store-bought or perhaps tortilla. Whatever you choose it is absolutely amazing.</h2>
        <p>We love pizza, of course, but I am a huge fan of tuna pizza. Often I would change toppings; sometimes I would use peppers, and feta or goat cheese and from time to time I make this just like this. Let me tell you, there is nothing like homemade easy tuna pizza</p>
        <h3 class="head">Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound pizza dough or 1 (10 ounces), pre-baked pizza crust works too</li>

            <li>1 cup shredded pizza cheese (mozzarella, provolone, parm, or a pizza blend)</li>
            <li>1 (6.7 ounces) jar Tuna in Olive Oil, reserve oil</li>
